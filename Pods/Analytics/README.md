## Development

libAnalytics itself strives to have as few dependencies as possible to create the most compatible and
lightweight Analytics SDK for ObjC developers. However, there is no such restriction during testing time,
and in order to contribute to the SDK, you will need cocoapods. This can be accomplished as follows:

    [sudo] gem install cocoapods
    pod install
